1. Functions help break down code into logical groups.
2. Function needs to be defined, then it can be called to execute it.
3. def statement creates the function. Typing the function name in code calls it.
4. A function call is an instance of a function that runs in a local scope.
Once the function call returns, the local scope is deleted.
5. One global scope, but multiple local scopes (infinite)
6. Variables in a local scope disappear when the function call returns.
7. Return value is the variable or variables that the function call sends back to the main function when the function is called.
Can a return value be part of ane xpression (?) ??? # TODO

8. None
9. Call the variable name with global before it
10. Class NoneType (?)
11. This imports a module areallyourpetsnamederic
12. import spam
spam.bacon() # this will call the function bacon in spam module.
13. Use exceptions if you expect certain errors to occur.
14. Put things that might have an error in the try clause.
Put what you want to happen if that error occurs in the except clause.
